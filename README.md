The algorithm for image segmentation consists of several steps. 
Initially, each pixel is assigned to its own segment. Then, the edges in 
the graph are sorted based on their weight. The algorithm iterates 
through the sorted edges and merges segments if the pixels they 
connect belong to different segments and the weight of the edge is 
below a given threshold value. The segmentation results are 
represented by an array that contains information about the 
identified clusters or segments in the image.After segmentation, the output is a region or a structure that 
collectively covers the entire image. These regions have similar 
characteristics including colors, texture, or intensity.
